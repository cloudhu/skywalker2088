# 1. Game Design
______
1. Energy collection: The spaceship has a conversion core that converts space ore into energy, and can also absorb the energy crystal core on the transformed space monster, which provides a steady supply of energy for the spaceship and the energy required for upgrading;
2. Spaceship upgrade: The core and components of Mecha monsters can be used as materials for spaceship upgrade, and the direction of upgrade mainly includes engine upgrade (faster moving speed), weapon upgrade, defense upgrade... Upgraded ships can deal with more powerful monsters;
3. Science and technology research: Through the exploration of civilization relics, players can collect science and technology points, unlock the science and technology tree, so that the spacecraft has more powerful skills, such as laser rays, gravitational wave detectors, drone clusters, super particle cannons...
